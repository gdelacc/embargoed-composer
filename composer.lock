Embargoed Composer
=======
Embargoed is [Rack](http://rack.rubyforge.org/) middleware with a [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) engine that blocks all requests from Russia and displays a pro-Ukraine message instead.

People are already working on making Wordpress and Django ports of this. If you port it to other platform, please let me know and I'll add your port to the [list of ports](https://github.com/rameerez/embargoed-list).

Here's the message that replaces all pages of your app:


<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/rameerez/embargoed/blob/main/public/embargoed-message.jpg?raw=true" alt="Embargoed message displayed to Russian visitors" width="400"/>
</p>



## Installation

Add this to your `Gemfile`:

    gem 'embargoed'

then run

    bundle install
    
_Note that you'll need to restart your Rails server before it works_

That's it! Just by having `embargoed` on your Gemfile your Rails app will display this message to all requests from a Russian IP.
